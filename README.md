HKMeans
=======

This is a naive implementation of the KMeans algorithm written in Haskell.
Yet it is still pretty efficient and work will be done to improve further
in term of performence and code quality.

Dependencies
------------

* hmatrix
* random
* stream-fusion

Installation
------------

It's really simple to install the package using cabal-install :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/remusao/HKMeans.git HKMeans
$ cd HKMeans
$ cabal install
```
